RELATIONAL DATABASES 

//Integer Reference Pattern
-we use integer columns in one table 
to reference (or look uo) rows in 
another table

//KEYS
PRIMARY KEY - generally ans integer auto-increment field
LOGICAL KEY - what the outside world uses for lookup
FOREIGN KEY - generally an integer key pointing to a row in another table 
 //best practices
 -never use your logical key as the primary key 
 -logical keys can and do change, albeit slowely
 -relationships that are based on matching string fields -
 are less efficient than integers

//FOREIGN keys 
-a foreign key is when a table has a column containing a key 
that points to the primary key of another table 
-when all primary keys are integers, then all foreign keys are integers
